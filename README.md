Visual Perception
===========================

1. Basic-geometry object segmentation
-------------------------------------

Mainly to be used with the soft PISA/IIT hand, since no perfect and precise description of the object is required, since this representation can be used to plan a power grasp.

3. Other utilities
------------------

- Tabletop Segmentation: finds the dominant plane in the scene, where objects are supposed to be lying down

- In-hand segmentation: performs either 1. or 2. object segmentation, when the object is within the hand (TODO).
